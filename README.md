This project is a simple url shortener application made via Django and SQlite. 
It creates shorter, randomized links for given url addresses while tracking their click count. 
It requires new users to login to the system before they create their short urls, so that it can track and list the saved url's for each existing user.

A user should make necessary migrations in order to run this project locally.
